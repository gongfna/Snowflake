# localisation
This package currently just acts as a place to hold the launch file we use to launch [robot_pose_ekf](http://wiki.ros.org/robot_pose_ekf), an Extended [Kalman Filter](http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/). However, if we elect to create more in-house localisation stuff, it should go in this package.
